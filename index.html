              <p class="paragraph-light">NFTs have been growing in popularity within artist circles because of its ability to assert the originality of their work. The NFT, or the token, is “minted” (remember this term!), which creates an unique entry on the blockchain (basically where the NFT will live from now on), and acts as proof of ownership. Artists are able to take a percentage of sales every time the NFT is traded on the platform. (Conti and Schmidt; Dean)</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">But first, some backstory</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">In order to comprehend the true impact of NFTs, we must first understand how NFTs are traded. NFTs are held on a blockchain, a public ledger that records transactions. Most NFTs exist on the Ethereum blockchain, which you might have heard of if you’re familiar with the crypto space. (McDonald)<br><br>The most energy-intensive process in creating, selling, and trading an NFT is the process of minting.<br><br>(Remember when I mentioned how this term would be important? Yeah, this is it here.)</p>
          <blockquote class="large-quote">&quot;Minting an NFT is the act of publishing a unique instance of your token (artwork, images, or even tweets) onto the blockchain and making it tradable and purchasable.&quot; (Velasquez)</blockquote>
          <p class="paragraph">In the process of minting, thus creating the NFT for sale, there are substantial ecological consequences. While listing NFTs on marketplaces aren’t energy intensive, the marketplace which hosts the listing will usually determine the amount of energy required for the minting process. Most marketplaces like OpenSea host the Ethereum blockchain, which uses proof-of-work to ensure the security of the transaction. (Velasquez; @minimalsm)<br><br>The following data shows the drastic increase in energy consumption during the minting process.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Proof-of what now?</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">In short, proof-of-work is the verification process which each NFT has to go through when traded on a blockchain that uses this method, one being Ethereum. This method of ensuring security is not only extremely energy intensive, but unsustainable to the point where it threatens the future of blockchains, NFT trading and cryptocurrency. (Anderson)<br><br>The following graph shows the energy used in the process of minting and trading cryptoart (aka NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain compared to the energy usage in multiple first and second world countries.

          <h2 class="section-heading">So what’s the issue?</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">Essentially, NFTs are the hot new trend (possibly here to stay). However, many artists and collectors fail to realise the true ecological cost of trading and selling this virtual collectibles. Amongst this new age of accelerated climate change (re: the ominous countdown clock in New York City’s Times Square), the true ecological impact of cryptocurrencies and NFT have been called into question.</p>
          <blockquote>Minting an NFT is the act of publishing a unique instance of your token (artwork, images, or even tweets) onto the blockchain and making it tradable and purchasable. (Velasquez)</blockquote>
          <p class="paragraph">This data shows the energy usage of NFT trading on the Ethereum blockchain. As you can see, the majority of trades on the blockchain uses around 200-300 kWh. To make it make sense, one transaction on the ETH blockchain is equivalent to driving 1276 km in a petrol car.  With the kilometers equivalent to 1 NFT transaction, you could drive from the most northern point of Italy all the way to the south, and with some to spare! (McDonald; Storey)<br><br>According to Storey (2022), each transaction on the Ethereum platform, where most NFTs are housed, consumes on average 48.14 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of energy. That’s around a day’s worth of energy consumption of a small family!</p>

        <div class="horizontal-div chart">
          <p class="paragraph-light">The average usage of a NFT transaction on the SuperRare platform is 340 kilowatts per hour, which is equivalent to 1000km of driving, or a 2 hour flight! What&#x27;s worse, all NFTs emit/consume around the same amount of carbon emissions/energy, regardless of the amount it is traded. Meaning a NFT that is traded a 100 times emits the same amount of carbon emissions as a NFT that is only traded once. Combined with the incentive to produce increasing amounts of NFTs to keep up with demand, the result will be ecologically catastrophic further down the line. (McDonald; Storey)</p>

        <p>And in case visualising the power consumption of a 2 hour flight is a little hard, here&#x27;s another example. 1 NFT sale on the SuperRare platform is equivalent to running a plugged in 16-inch Macbook Pro (which is what this is being typed up on) for more than 7,000 hours! That&#x27;s running a laptop uninterrupted for close to 304 days! (McDonald)</p>

        <p>If you’re looking to make your first purchase, or create your own NFTs, but are concerned about the ecological impact, here’s some good news for you.<br><br>Ethereum 2.0, a newly developed platform based on the current Ethereum blockchain, now uses proof-of-work, a less energy intensive, yet equally efficient alternative that can house and trade NFTs. Memo Akten, the source of which most of this data has been gathered from, has compiled a list of eco-friendly, or less ecologically damaging platforms where you can trade and sell your NFT artwork without causing significant harm to our already fragile ecosystem. Moreover, an increasing number of blockchains utilising proof-of-work and proof-of-stake systems are currently being developed and deployed. A list of those blockchains will also be included at the end of this article. (McDonald)<br><br>The goal of this article is not to dissuade people from buying and trading non-fungible artwork, but to implore the audience to consider the greater ecological impact of their actions. Whether or not you are hoping to delve into the NFT space, I hope you&#x27;ve learnt something today. <br></p>
